=========

This is a (simple) hobby project to learn Bridge (the card game) and C#


Status
------
  *This may be out of date, so check the code.*
  
  Currently the code manages the basic rules of play and supports
  a console based human player.
  
  Work is underway to model and implement the AI for computer based play.
  
Usage
-----

  There is no makefile for this project.  The code is organized in a
  _MonoDevelop_ 2.8 project file which should be compatible with
  _Visual Studio 2010_.  Building the project is easiest in one of those
  environments.
